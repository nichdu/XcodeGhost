"XcodeGhost" Source clarification on the so-called "XcodeGhost" of

First of all, I XcodeGhost event to bring confusion apologize. XcodeGhost from my own experiments, without any threatening behavior, as detailed in the source code: https://github.com/XcodeGhostSource/XcodeGhost

The so-called XcodeGhost is actually hard to force an unexpected iOS developers find: Modify Xcode compiler configuration text file specified code can be loaded, so I wrote the code above annex to try and upload it to your network disk.

All data in the code actually acquired basic app information: application name, application version number, system version number, language, country name, symbol developer, app installation time, device name, device type. In addition, you do not get any other data. Solemn note is required: for selfish reasons, I joined the advertising features in the code, hope can promote their applications (off the source code can be compared to the Annex do check). But in fact, from the beginning to the final shut down the server, I have not used the advertising function. And in 10 days ago, I have taken the initiative off the server and remove all data, but will not have any effect on anyone.

Willing rumors would stop the truth, the so-called "XcodeGhost", used to be a wrong experiment, after just completely dead code only.

It is emphasized that, XcodeGhost App will not affect any use, but does not obtain private data, only a dead piece of code.

Again sincerely apologize, wish you a pleasant weekend
